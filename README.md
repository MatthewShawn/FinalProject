# wikiRabbitHole

Because of wiki's security methodology, we were unable to get around the CORs errors on the client side in a react app.  Our efforts to move the wiki calls to the server side fell short in the time allotted.  We will be demonstrating via our own computer using http, rather than https.

Oll other calls and routes are working.





# Create React Express App

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
